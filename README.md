# BSc-Thesis-Code
This repository contains the code used in my bachelor thesis called "Optimizing Synchrotron Transfer Coefficients with Weighted Sums"

The code is made in Jupyter Notebook Python, so you will find this code to be in the .ipynb format. 

Additionally, the Symphony data used in the code is also uploaded as .csv files. To get the same results as in the thesis, use the correct path to the correct .csv file. If you want to use other data I would recommend installing Symphony and compute the results you want. The steps to installing Symphony can be found at https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/symphony/tree/master.
